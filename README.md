IPython notebooks
=======================
This repository intends to be a collection of IPython notebooks that deal with aspects of sedimentology / sedimentary geology. You can read them in nbviewer:

- [Grain settling](http://nbviewer.org/github/zsylvester/notebooks/blob/master/grain_settling.ipynb) - Plotting and comparing settling velocities calculated with different methods (Stokes, turbulent, and Ferguson-Church)

- [Submarine channel sinuosities](http://nbviewer.org/github/zsylvester/notebooks/blob/master/channel_sinuosities.ipynb) â€” A critical look at how submarine channel sinuosities change with latitude and slope
